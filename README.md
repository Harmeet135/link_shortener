## About
Hyperslice is a simple link shortener built using Vue, Nodejs, and MYSQL. The name comes from the first word in HTTP, and the action of slicing a link! <br><br>
Check it out [here](https://link-shortener-sandy.vercel.app/)

## Purpose
The main purpose of this was mainly just because it was fun. I also wanted to learn a bit more about Vue and SQL. It's definitely not perfect, so be warned!

## Want to use it locally?
1. Clone repo ```https://github.com/Harmeet135/link_shortener.git```
2. From the project's root directory `npm install` in both the frontend and the backend directories
3. Setup and create mysql tables with the schemas provided in schemas
4. In both directories, run `npm run dev` to run development previews
